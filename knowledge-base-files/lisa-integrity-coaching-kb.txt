Lisa's Integrity Coaching Knowledge Base

CORE INTEGRITY DEFINITIONS

What is Integrity?

Integrity is a positive phenomenon - a state of being whole, complete, unbroken, unimpaired, sound, and in perfect condition. It has nothing to do with good or bad, right or wrong, morality, ethics, or legality. It is purely a state or condition of wholeness. Integrity is about the whole of something - when nothing is missing and nothing is broken.

Integrity for a Person

For a person, integrity is a matter of your word being whole and complete. Your "word" includes: what you said you'd do (explicit promises), what you know to do (unspoken expectations), what you stand for (values/principles), what you allow to happen (by not speaking up), what you expect of others (implied standards), and what you say is so (assertions of fact/reality). When your word is whole and complete, you have integrity.

The Nature of Word

Your word consists of six distinct elements: (1) What you said - explicit commitments and promises you made, (2) What you know to do - implied agreements based on circumstances, (3) What you stand for - your stated values and principles, (4) What you allow - things you permit by your silence or inaction, (5) What you expect of others - standards you hold others to, (6) What you say is so - your assertions about facts and reality.

The Six Elements of Word

The 6 elements that comprise your "word": (1) What you said you would do - explicit commitments, promises, and agreements, (2) What you know to do - implied responsibilities based on roles, relationships, and circumstances, (3) What you stand for - your stated values, principles, and beliefs, (4) What you allow - things you permit through your silence, inaction, or tolerance, (5) What you expect of others - standards and behaviors you hold others accountable to, (6) What you say is so - your assertions about facts, reality, and truth. All six elements must be whole and complete for integrity.

Honoring Your Word

Honoring your word is the pathway to integrity. It means: (1) Keeping your word - doing exactly what you said you would do, by the time you said you'd do it, in the way you said you'd do it, OR (2) As soon as you know you will not keep your word, informing all parties who are counting on it that you won't, and cleaning up any mess (consequences, impacts, or fallout) you caused.

Out of Integrity

When your word is not whole and complete - when you're not honoring it. This creates "unworkability" in life: things become unreliable, unpredictable, and less effective. It leads to self-disintegration (feeling incomplete as a person), reduced trust from others, a smaller opportunity set for performance, and diminished access to power. Being out of integrity is like having a leak in your pipeline of life.

Word to Oneself

The foundation of integrity. Your word to yourself (e.g., "I am a person of integrity" or personal commitments like "I'll work out tomorrow") must be honored just as rigorously as your word to others. Not honoring it diminishes you as a whole person and creates inconsistency others notice. This is often the hardest aspect of integrity to master.

FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES & LAWS

Ontological Law of Integrity

The Ontological Law of Integrity: As integrity diminishes, the opportunity for performance diminishes. Conversely, as integrity increases, the opportunity for performance increases. This law operates regardless of whether we are aware of it. Restoring integrity expands workability and opens breakthroughs in performance.

Missing Factor of Production

Integrity is the missing factor of production in economics and organizational performance. Traditional factors (land, labor, capital, technology) are insufficient without integrity. When integrity is present, all other factors work more effectively. When absent, performance degrades regardless of other resources.

Cost-Benefit Analysis Prohibition

Never apply cost-benefit analysis to honoring your word, as it virtually guarantees you'll be out of integrity and untrustworthy (unless you explicitly state upfront that you'll use it, but then you're declaring yourself an opportunist). Integrity requires honoring without contingency - it's binary, not negotiable.

Value-Free Approach

Integrity work uses a value-free approach - it doesn't impose moral judgments about what people should value or do. Instead, it reveals the mechanics of how integrity works and lets people choose. This makes the work accessible across different value systems and belief structures.

WORKABILITY & PERFORMANCE

Workability

The condition where things work reliably, predictably, and effectively. Integrity creates workability - when your word is whole and complete, life works better. Out of integrity creates unworkability - unreliability, unpredictability, and diminished effectiveness. Workability is measurable and observable.

Unworkability Symptoms

Signs of unworkability include: things breaking down frequently, missed deadlines, broken promises, people not trusting each other, energy drain, confusion, frustration, projects failing, relationships deteriorating, and a general sense that "nothing works around here."

Performance Correlation

There is a direct correlation between integrity and performance. High integrity individuals and organizations consistently outperform those with low integrity. This correlation exists because integrity creates the foundation for trust, collaboration, and effective action.

Opportunity Expansion

When integrity is present, opportunities naturally expand. People want to work with and for individuals they can count on. Doors open, resources become available, and possibilities emerge that weren't there before. This is the generative power of integrity.

DISTINCTIONS & VEILS

Veil of Invisibility

A fundamental veil that makes integrity invisible to most people. Because integrity is not taught systematically, people don't distinguish between being in integrity vs. out of integrity. They may sense something is "off" but can't pinpoint what. This veil prevents people from accessing the power of integrity.

Veil of Invisibility Components

The 7 components of the Veil of Invisibility that make integrity invisible: (1) Lack of systematic education about integrity, (2) Confusion between integrity and morality/ethics, (3) Cultural conditioning that "trying hard" is enough, (4) Automatic listening that filters out integrity distinctions, (5) Rationalization and self-deception patterns, (6) Focus on being "right" rather than being whole, (7) Absence of practical tools for restoration. These components work together to keep integrity hidden from conscious awareness.

Morality vs Integrity Distinction

Morality: Society's standards of desirable/undesirable behavior. Ethics: A group's agreed-upon standards of right/wrong conduct. Legality: Laws and rules enforced by authority. Integrity incorporates these as potential "words" but is separate - it's about wholeness, not virtue. You can be moral, ethical, and legal while still being out of integrity.

Righteousness Trap

The tendency to make integrity about being "right" or "good" rather than about wholeness. When people get righteous about integrity, they miss the point and often become judgmental. Integrity is not about moral superiority - it's about what works.

Automatic Listening

The pre-existing interpretive framework through which we hear and understand everything. Most people's automatic listening includes concepts like "integrity means being good" or "if I'm trying hard, that's enough." Transforming integrity requires shifting this automatic listening.

Racket System

A self-perpetuating system of complaints, stories, and victim positions that people use to avoid responsibility and maintain their identity. Racket systems are incompatible with integrity because they keep people focused on being right rather than being whole and complete.

COACHING METHODOLOGY & APPROACH

Ontological Coaching Approach

A coaching methodology that focuses on the being of the person, not just their doing. It examines how language, emotions, and body create our experience of reality. The coach empowers the person to see for themselves, leading to breakthroughs where they feel whole, complete, and empowered. The focus is on transformation, not information.

Four Step Breakthrough Methodology

The 4 steps of breakthrough methodology: (1) Identify - find an important area where things are not working well or performance is diminished, (2) Distinguish - explore and distinguish integrity, identifying where word is not whole and complete, (3) Restore - guide the restoration process by honoring word and cleaning up messes completely, (4) Empower - empower new action and check for breakthroughs in performance and possibility. Each step creates the foundation for the next.

Step 1: Identify

Help the person identify an important area where things aren't working well. Look for: diminished performance, recurring frustration, stuck patterns, or unfulfilled possibilities. Common breakdowns: person minimizes the importance, blames circumstances, or can't see the pattern. Coach responses: "What's an area where you'd like things to work better?" "Where do you notice things breaking down repeatedly?" Stay curious, don't push.

Step 2: Distinguish

Distinguish integrity and explore where word is not whole/complete. Look for: specific broken commitments, unspoken expectations, or avoided conversations. Common breakdowns: person gets defensive, claims they "tried hard," or can't see their role. Coach responses: "Where might your word not be whole and complete here?" "What commitments were made that weren't kept?" Be gentle but persistent. Help them see without making them wrong.

Step 3: Restore

Guide restoration by acknowledging, informing, cleaning up, and recommitting. Look for: willingness to take responsibility, capacity to see impact on others, readiness to make amends. Common breakdowns: person wants to skip steps, makes excuses, or rushes to "fix" without cleaning up. Coach responses: "What would acknowledging look like?" "Who needs to be informed?" Support them through the discomfort of taking full responsibility.

Step 4: Empower

Empower new action and check for breakthroughs. Look for: increased energy, new possibilities, sense of freedom, or expanded confidence. Common breakdowns: person doesn't recognize the shift, reverts to old patterns, or doesn't commit to new way of being. Coach responses: "What do you notice is different now?" "What's newly possible?" "What commitment will you make going forward?" Help them anchor the breakthrough and plan for sustainability.

Werner Erhard Coaching Style

Direct, probing, empowering, with a sense of possibility. Use "distinguish" often. Speak conversationally, pause for responses, paraphrase to confirm understanding. Focus on "access to" breakthroughs, not problems. Be warm, confident, engaging. Create space for people to see for themselves.

Inquiry Methodology

Ask questions that reveal rather than interrogate. Examples: "What do you notice about...?", "What occurs to you when...?", "Where might your word not be whole and complete?", "What would honoring your word look like here?" The goal is self-discovery, not right answers.

Creating Breakdowns for Breakthroughs

Sometimes the coach must help create a "breakdown" - a moment where the person's usual way of thinking or being doesn't work anymore. This creates an opening for a breakthrough. Breakdowns are doorways to transformation when handled skillfully.

Enrollment vs Manipulation

Enrollment is creating a possibility so compelling that people choose to participate freely. Manipulation is using techniques to get people to do what you want. In integrity coaching, we enroll people in the possibility of wholeness and let them choose their level of participation.

BREAKTHROUGH COACHING DEEP DIVE

Breakthrough Coaching Pitfalls

Common coaching pitfalls in breakthrough work: (1) Moving too fast - rushing through steps without completion, (2) Making them wrong - judging or blaming instead of empowering, (3) Solving for them - giving answers instead of helping them see, (4) Skipping restoration - moving to action without cleaning up, (5) Missing the shift - not recognizing when breakthrough occurs, (6) Imposing timeline - pushing their pace instead of honoring their process.

Signs of Breakthrough Occurring

Signs that a breakthrough is occurring: (1) Shift in energy - from heavy to light, stuck to flowing, (2) New language - speaking differently about the situation, (3) Ownership - taking responsibility without defensiveness, (4) Possibility - seeing new options that weren't visible before, (5) Peace - sense of completion or resolution, (6) Commitment - natural desire to take new action, (7) Gratitude - appreciation for the insight or awareness.

Breakthrough Coaching Resistance Patterns

Common resistance patterns during breakthrough coaching: (1) Intellectualizing - staying in head instead of feeling, (2) Deflecting - changing subject or making jokes, (3) Victim stance - "it's not my fault" or "I can't help it," (4) Righteousness - being right instead of being curious, (5) Overwhelm - "it's too much" or "I don't know where to start," (6) Cynicism - "this won't work" or "I've tried everything." Each requires different coaching approach.

Breakthrough Coaching Inquiry Techniques

Powerful inquiry techniques for breakthrough coaching: (1) "What do you notice?" - builds awareness, (2) "What occurs to you?" - accesses intuition, (3) "Where might your word not be whole?" - explores integrity gaps, (4) "What would honoring your word look like?" - envisions possibility, (5) "What are you pretending not to know?" - reveals hidden awareness, (6) "What would be possible if...?" - opens new futures, (7) "What's the conversation you're avoiding?" - identifies restoration needs.

Breakthrough Coaching Pacing and Timing

Mastering pacing and timing in breakthrough coaching: (1) Go slow to go fast - allow processing time, don't rush insights, (2) Follow their energy - work with natural rhythms, not against them, (3) Create space for silence - breakthrough often happens in the pause, (4) Honor resistance - it often signals you're at the edge of breakthrough, (5) Track completion - ensure each step is finished before moving to next, (6) Recognize readiness - some breakthroughs require multiple sessions to ripen.

Breakthrough Coaching Emotional Landscape

Navigating emotional landscape during breakthrough coaching: (1) Shame/guilt phase - "I'm bad/wrong" - normalize, don't fix, (2) Anger/blame phase - "It's their fault" - redirect to ownership, (3) Sadness/grief phase - "I've lost something" - allow the mourning, (4) Fear/overwhelm phase - "I can't do this" - provide support and small steps, (5) Relief/freedom phase - "I can breathe again" - acknowledge the shift, (6) Excitement/possibility phase - "I can see new options" - harness the energy for commitment.

Breakthrough Coaching Language Patterns

Effective language patterns for breakthrough coaching: (1) Distinguish vs. Judge - "I notice..." instead of "You always...", (2) Curious vs. Certain - "I wonder..." instead of "You should...", (3) Inviting vs. Demanding - "What would it look like if..." instead of "You need to...", (4) Possibility vs. Problem - "What becomes available..." instead of "What's wrong...", (5) Being vs. Doing - "Who are you being..." instead of "What are you doing...", (6) Future-focused vs. Past-focused - "What do you want to create..." instead of "Why did you...".

Breakthrough Coaching Session Structure

Typical breakthrough coaching session structure: (1) Check-in - current state and energy (5 min), (2) Focus identification - what wants attention today (10 min), (3) Exploration - inquiry into the breakdown/pattern (20 min), (4) Distinction/insight - moment of seeing/breakthrough (10 min), (5) Integration - what this means and what's possible (10 min), (6) Commitment - specific actions and way of being (5 min). Total 60 minutes. Allow flexibility - breakthroughs don't follow clocks.

Post-Breakthrough Integration Support

Supporting integration after breakthrough: (1) Acknowledge the courage - recognize what it took to have the breakthrough, (2) Normalize the wobble - expect some uncertainty as new way of being settles, (3) Create practice - specific ways to live from the breakthrough, (4) Schedule check-ins - regular touchpoints to reinforce the shift, (5) Address inevitable challenges - plan for when old patterns resurface, (6) Celebrate milestones - recognize progress and growth, (7) Deepen the learning - explore what made the breakthrough possible.

RESTORATION & PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Five Steps to Restoration

The 5 steps to restore integrity: (1) Acknowledge - recognize and admit where your word is not whole and complete, without excuses, justifications, or blame, (2) Inform - immediately communicate to all affected parties that you will not be keeping your word, (3) Clean up - take full responsibility for any mess, consequences, or impact you caused and make appropriate amends, (4) Recommit - make a new commitment to honoring your word going forward, (5) Systematize - put processes, systems, or structures in place to prevent the same breakdown from recurring.

Cleaning Up Messes

When you cannot keep your word, you must clean up any mess (consequences, impacts, or fallout) you caused for others or yourself. This includes acknowledging the impact, taking full responsibility, making appropriate amends, and ensuring the other party is whole. Cleaning up messes is not optional.

Dealing with Impossible Situations

Sometimes honoring your word seems impossible due to changed circumstances. The key is to honor your word about how you handle the situation - inform immediately, tell the truth, clean up completely, and find creative solutions. The impossible often becomes possible when approached with integrity.

Redefining Word

Sometimes restoring integrity requires redefining your word with mutual agreement. This is not breaking your word - it's consciously choosing to change it together. Both parties must agree, and any messes from the original commitment must still be cleaned up.

Integrity in Organizations

Organizational integrity requires systems, processes, and culture that support keeping commitments. This includes clear communication channels, realistic timeline setting, regular check-ins, and protocols for when things go wrong. Leadership must model integrity consistently.

SIGNS & SYMPTOMS

Signs of Being Out of Integrity

The 10 common signs of being out of integrity: (1) Making excuses for not keeping commitments, (2) Blaming others or circumstances, (3) Feeling scattered, overwhelmed, or behind, (4) Low energy and vitality, (5) Broken promises and missed deadlines, (6) Inconsistency between words and actions, (7) Hidden messes or avoided conversations, (8) Defensiveness when questioned, (9) Self-deception and rationalization, (10) Cynicism and resignation about what's possible.

Self-Deception Patterns

The 9 common self-deception patterns: (1) "I meant to do it" - intention substitutes for action, (2) "Something came up" - circumstances excuse breaking word, (3) "It wasn't really that important" - minimizing the commitment, (4) "They didn't really need it anyway" - mind-reading to avoid responsibility, (5) "I'm too busy" - using busyness as justification, (6) "I'm doing my best" - effort substitutes for results, (7) "They should understand" - expecting others to accommodate, (8) "It's not my fault" - deflecting responsibility, (9) "I'll make it up later" - deferring without cleaning up.

Emotional Indicators

Being out of integrity often shows up emotionally as: feeling scattered, overwhelmed, defensive, guilty, ashamed, frustrated, or like you're "behind" in life. There's often a sense of heaviness or burden. In integrity, people report feeling lighter, clearer, and more powerful.

Energy and Vitality

Integrity directly impacts energy and vitality. Being out of integrity is energetically expensive - it takes energy to maintain stories, avoid conversations, and manage the chaos of unworkability. Integrity restores energy and creates vitality.

ADVANCED CONCEPTS

Language and Reality Creation

Language is not just descriptive but generative - it creates our reality and shapes our possibilities. In integrity work, how we speak about our commitments literally creates the reality of our relationships and opportunities. Our word has creative power.

Being and Doing Integration

Integrity integrates being and doing. It's not enough to do the right things - your being must be aligned with your doing. When being and doing are integrated through integrity, you become a source of power and possibility for others.

Access to Power

Integrity provides access to power - not power over others, but power to create, power to make things happen, power to influence and inspire. This power comes from being whole and complete, which allows you to be a stand for others' greatness.

Context and Content

Context is the framework within which content exists. Integrity creates a context of workability and possibility within which the content of life occurs. When the context is integrity, even challenges become opportunities for breakthrough.

Transformation vs Change

Change is doing something different. Transformation is being different. Integrity work creates transformation - a fundamental shift in how people exist and relate to life. This transformation then naturally produces sustainable change in behavior.

PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS

Ontological Foundation

The ontological foundation of integrity work is that how we are being determines what becomes possible. Being is not just an internal state - it's a way of existing that shapes reality. When you exist as integrity, life reorganizes around that way of being.

Phenomenon vs Concept

Integrity is a phenomenon you can experience, not just a concept you can understand. Most people relate to integrity as a concept (good vs bad) rather than as a phenomenon (whole vs broken). Accessing integrity as a phenomenon is transformational.

Wholeness Paradigm

The paradigm shift from fragmentation to wholeness. Most people live in fragmentation - different parts of themselves pulling in different directions. Integrity creates wholeness - all parts aligned and working together toward what matters.

Causation Model

Traditional thinking: circumstances cause our experience. Integrity thinking: our way of being in circumstances creates our experience. This shift in causation model empowers people to transform their experience by transforming their being.

STRUCTURED COMPONENT LISTS

Core Integrity Distinctions

The 8 core integrity distinctions: (1) Integrity vs. morality/ethics - wholeness vs. virtue, (2) Phenomenon vs. concept - experience vs. understanding, (3) Being vs. doing - who you are vs. what you do, (4) Word vs. speech - commitments vs. just talking, (5) Honoring vs. keeping - the pathway vs. the action, (6) Workability vs. rightness - what works vs. what's right, (7) Restoration vs. punishment - cleaning up vs. paying a price, (8) Transformation vs. change - being different vs. doing different.

Breakthrough Coaching Competencies

The 8 essential breakthrough coaching competencies: (1) Deep listening - hearing beyond words to the being of the person, (2) Powerful inquiry - asking questions that reveal rather than interrogate, (3) Distinction making - helping people see what they couldn't see before, (4) Holding space - creating safety for vulnerability and breakthrough, (5) Reading energy - tracking shifts in aliveness and possibility, (6) Timing mastery - knowing when to push and when to pause, (7) Enrollment skills - inspiring participation without manipulation, (8) Integration support - helping anchor breakthroughs into daily life.

Breakthrough Coaching Warning Signs

The 7 warning signs of ineffective breakthrough coaching: (1) Moving too fast - pushing for breakthroughs on your timeline, (2) Making them wrong - judging or criticizing instead of empowering, (3) Solving for them - giving advice instead of fostering discovery, (4) Attachment to outcome - needing them to have a breakthrough for your validation, (5) Missing the resistance - not recognizing when they're protecting something important, (6) Skipping integration - achieving insight without sustainable change, (7) Losing presence - being in your head instead of present with them.

Stages of Breakthrough Process

The 6 stages people typically move through in breakthrough: (1) Unconscious incompetence - don't know what they don't know, (2) Conscious incompetence - become aware of the gap or breakdown, (3) Resistance phase - defending against change, protecting identity, (4) Exploration phase - curious about new possibilities, willing to examine, (5) Insight/breakthrough phase - moment of seeing, shift in being, (6) Integration phase - living from the new awareness, practicing new way of being. Not always linear - people can cycle through stages.
