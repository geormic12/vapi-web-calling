## Core Integrity Definitions

### What is Integrity?

Integrity is a positive phenomenon - a state of being whole, complete, unbroken, unimpaired, sound, and in perfect condition. It has nothing to do with good or bad, right or wrong, morality, ethics, or legality. It is purely a state or condition of wholeness. Integrity is about the whole of something - when nothing is missing and nothing is broken.

### Integrity for a Person

For a person, integrity is a matter of your word being whole and complete. Your "word" includes: what you said you'd do (explicit promises), what you know to do (unspoken expectations), what you stand for (values/principles), what you allow to happen (by not speaking up), what you expect of others (implied standards), and what you say is so (assertions of fact/reality). When your word is whole and complete, you have integrity.

### The Six Elements of Word

The 6 elements that comprise your "word":

1. **What you said you would do** - explicit commitments, promises, and agreements
2. **What you know to do** - implied responsibilities based on roles, relationships, and circumstances
3. **What you stand for** - your stated values, principles, and beliefs
4. **What you allow** - things you permit through your silence, inaction, or tolerance
5. **What you expect of others** - standards and behaviors you hold others accountable to
6. **What you say is so** - your assertions about facts, reality, and truth

All six elements must be whole and complete for integrity.

### Veil of Invisibility

A fundamental veil that makes integrity invisible to most people. Because integrity is not taught systematically, people don't distinguish between being in integrity vs. out of integrity. They may sense something is "off" but can't pinpoint what. This veil prevents people from accessing the power of integrity.

The 7 components of the Veil of Invisibility that make integrity invisible:

1. Lack of systematic education about integrity
2. Confusion between integrity and morality/ethics
3. Cultural conditioning that "trying hard" is enough
4. Automatic listening that filters out integrity distinctions
5. Rationalization and self-deception patterns
6. Focus on being "right" rather than being whole
7. Absence of practical tools for restoration

These components work together to keep integrity hidden from conscious awareness.

### Honoring Your Word

Honoring your word is the pathway to integrity. It means:

1. **Keeping your word** - doing exactly what you said you would do, by the time you said you'd do it, in the way you said you'd do it, OR
2. **As soon as you know you will not keep your word**, informing all parties who are counting on it that you won't, and cleaning up any mess (consequences, impacts, or fallout) you caused.

### Out of Integrity

When your word is not whole and complete - when you're not honoring it. This creates "unworkability" in life: things become unreliable, unpredictable, and less effective. It leads to self-disintegration (feeling incomplete as a person), reduced trust from others, a smaller opportunity set for performance, and diminished access to power. Being out of integrity is like having a leak in your pipeline of life.

## Four Step Breakthrough Methodology

The 4 steps of breakthrough methodology:

### Step 1: Identify

Find an important area where things are not working well or performance is diminished. Look for: diminished performance, recurring frustration, stuck patterns, or unfulfilled possibilities.

### Step 2: Distinguish

Explore and distinguish integrity, identifying where word is not whole and complete. Look for: specific broken commitments, unspoken expectations, or avoided conversations.

### Step 3: Restore

Guide the restoration process by honoring word and cleaning up messes completely. This includes acknowledging, informing, cleaning up, and recommitting.

### Step 4: Empower

Empower new action and check for breakthroughs in performance and possibility. Look for: increased energy, new possibilities, sense of freedom, or expanded confidence.

## Ontological Law of Integrity

The Ontological Law of Integrity: As integrity diminishes, the opportunity for performance diminishes. Conversely, as integrity increases, the opportunity for performance increases. This law operates regardless of whether we are aware of it. Restoring integrity expands workability and opens breakthroughs in performance.

This serves as the foundation for Lisa's integrity coaching conversations.
