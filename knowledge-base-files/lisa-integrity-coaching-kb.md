# Lisa's Integrity Coaching Knowledge Base

## Core Integrity Concepts

### What is Integrity?

Integrity is the state of being whole and complete, where your word, actions, and being are aligned. It's not about being good or moral, but about functional workability in life. When you operate with integrity, you experience increased effectiveness, authentic self-expression, and enhanced performance in all areas of life.

### The Nature of Integrity

Integrity is a positive phenomenon that occurs when you honor your word as yourself. When integrity is present, workability and performance increase dramatically. It's not a moral stance but a functional approach to living that creates possibility and freedom.

### Integrity as Wholeness

True integrity means being whole and complete - nothing missing, nothing broken. It's the foundation from which authentic action and genuine possibility emerge. When you're operating from integrity, you have access to your full power and creativity.

### Restoring Integrity

When integrity is out, it can be restored through:

- Acknowledgment of what happened
- Taking responsibility without making excuses
- Making new agreements that you can actually keep
- Completing incomplete communications
- Cleaning up any mess created by the breakdown

## Ontological Coaching Methodology

### Being vs. Doing

Ontological coaching focuses on the being of a person rather than just their actions. Transformation occurs at the level of being - who you are, not just what you do. When being shifts, doing naturally follows.

### Language and Reality

Language doesn't just describe reality - it creates reality. The way we speak shapes our experience and possibilities. Through powerful distinctions in language, we can create new realities and possibilities for ourselves and others.

### Creating Distinctions

Powerful coaching creates new distinctions that allow people to see themselves and their world differently. A distinction is a difference that makes a difference - it opens up new possibilities for action and being.

### The Observer

We are always looking from a particular perspective or "way of being." The observer is the vantage point from which we see and interpret reality. Shifting the observer creates access to new possibilities and actions.

## Werner Erhard's Methodology

### Transformation vs. Change

Change is about doing something different. Transformation is about being different. In transformation, what shows up is a whole new way of being from which new actions and possibilities naturally emerge.

### What's Missing vs. What's Wrong

Instead of focusing on what's wrong and trying to fix it, ontological coaching looks at what's missing and works to create it. This creates possibility rather than merely solving problems.

### Creating vs. Reacting

Most people live reactively, responding to circumstances. Transformation creates the possibility of living as the source of your life - creating your circumstances rather than being at the effect of them.

### The Clearing

A clearing is a space of possibility. Like a forest clearing where light can enter and new growth can occur, a conversational clearing creates space for new possibilities to emerge.

## Coaching Principles and Practices

### Powerful Questions

Effective coaching uses questions that:

- Create new distinctions
- Shift perspective
- Generate possibility
- Reveal assumptions
- Open new conversations

### Listening for Possibility

Listen not just for what's being said, but for what's possible. Listen for the person's commitment, their concerns, and what they're creating or trying to create.

### Being vs. Seeming

Authenticity means being rather than seeming. It's about expressing who you really are rather than trying to appear a certain way or manage others' perceptions.

### Enrollment vs. Selling

Enrollment is about creating a shared vision and commitment. It's not about convincing or selling, but about creating alignment and shared possibility.

## Practical Applications

### Personal Integrity Inventory

Regular self-assessment of:

- Agreements kept vs. broken
- Incomplete communications
- Areas where you're not being authentic
- Places where you're withholding
- Commitments that need to be updated or released

### Workability Assessment

Examining areas of life for:

- What's working well
- What's not working
- What's missing
- What would make the biggest difference
- What you're committed to creating

### Communication Completion

Completing conversations by:

- Saying what needs to be said
- Acknowledging what happened
- Taking responsibility
- Making new agreements
- Expressing appreciation and acknowledgment

## Advanced Concepts

### Context and Content

Context is the framework or background within which content exists. Shifting context can completely transform the meaning and possibility of content. Coaching often works at the level of context rather than content.

### Occurrence vs. Story

What occurred is what actually happened. The story is our interpretation, meaning-making, and narrative about what occurred. Separating occurrence from story creates freedom and new possibility.

### Commitment vs. Preference

A commitment is a stand you take regardless of circumstances. A preference is something you'd like but aren't necessarily committed to creating. Transformation requires commitment, not just preference.

### The Racket

A racket is a persistent complaint that you use to avoid taking responsibility and action. It's a way of being right about why something can't be done or why you're not responsible.

## Coaching Conversations

### Creating Safety and Trust

Establishing a container where:

- People can be vulnerable and authentic
- Judgment is suspended
- Confidentiality is honored
- The person's greatness is seen and affirmed

3. Identifying what's missing or not working
