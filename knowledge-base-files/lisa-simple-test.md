## What is Integrity?

Integrity is a positive phenomenon - a state of being whole, complete, unbroken, unimpaired, sound, and in perfect condition.

## Veil of Invisibility

A fundamental veil that makes integrity invisible to most people. The 7 components are:

1. Lack of systematic education about integrity
2. Confusion between integrity and morality/ethics
3. Cultural conditioning that "trying hard" is enough
4. Automatic listening that filters out integrity distinctions
5. Rationalization and self-deception patterns
6. Focus on being "right" rather than being whole
7. Absence of practical tools for restoration

## Six Elements of Word

1. What you said you would do
2. What you know to do
3. What you stand for
4. What you allow
5. What you expect of others
6. What you say is so

All six elements must be whole and complete for integrity.
