### 8. Fred - "Frameworks and est Methodology"

- **Focus**: Systematic approaches, est framework application
- **Files Created**:
  - `fred-prompt.js` - System prompt focused on frameworks
  - `fred-knowledge-base.js` - Framework methodology, est principles
  - `fred-functions.js` - Function handler with ExploreFrameworks, ApplyEstMethodology
- **Key Concepts**: Systematic transformation, est principles, breakthrough methodologies

## Technical Integration

### Registry Updates

- **agent-registry.js**: Added all 8 new agents with complete configurations including:

  - System prompts
  - Voice configurations
  - First messages
  - Function definitions
  - Model settings
  - Transcriber settings

- **function-handler-registry.js**: Registered all 8 new function handlers for proper routing

### Function Handler Pattern

Each agent follows the established pattern:

- Search knowledge base functionality
- 2-3 specialized functions per agent
- Consistent error handling
- Structured return format: `{ success, data, agent, message }`

### Knowledge Base Architecture

- Each agent has dedicated knowledge base Map with categorized entries
- Consistent structure: `{ category, content, keywords }`
- Search functionality with relevance scoring
- Stats and utility functions for each knowledge base

## Werner Erhard Ontological Framework Integration

All agents are built on Werner Erhard's ontological coaching principles:

- Focus on being rather than doing
- Distinction-based awareness
- Transformation through consciousness shifts
- Language as reality-creating mechanism
- Phenomenological awareness
- Authentic expression and contribution

## Build and Testing

- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful (with size warnings due to expanded functionality)
- **Bundle Size**: 429 KiB (expanded from previous due to 8 new agents)
- **Integration**: All agents properly registered and accessible
- **Server**: Running on localhost:8000 for testing

## Next Steps

1. **Voice Customization**: Consider unique voice configurations for each agent
2. **Knowledge Base Enhancement**: Expand knowledge bases based on usage patterns
3. **UI Enhancements**: Add agent-specific styling or icons
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting for bundle size optimization
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all agent functions and interactions
