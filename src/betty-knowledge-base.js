When someone is "given by something greater," they operate from contribution rather than transaction, from commitment rather than wanting, and from service to life rather than service to ego. This creates access to fulfillment, power, and effectiveness unavailable when operating from self-concern alone.',

This call is not a "should" or obligation, but an authentic arising from their being. When someone follows this call, they experience natural fulfillment and access resources they didn\'t know they had.',
