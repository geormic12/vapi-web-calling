        category: 'integrity',
        content: 'Integrity is a state of being whole, complete, unbroken, and sound. For a person, integrity means your word is whole and complete - you do what you say you\'ll do, honor what you know to do, stand for what you believe, and take responsibility for what you allow. Integrity creates workability, reliability, and trust in your life.',

    }],

    ['integrity statement creation', {
        category: 'integrity',
        content: 'Creating a powerful integrity statement involves declaring your commitment to wholeness and completeness in specific areas of your life. It should be clear, actionable, and meaningful to you. A good integrity statement often includes what you commit to doing, how you will honor your word, and what wholeness looks like in that area.',

        category: 'integrity',

Together, they create a foundation for powerful, trustworthy, and genuine living. You can be authentic without integrity, or have integrity without being authentic, but combining them creates extraordinary effectiveness.',
